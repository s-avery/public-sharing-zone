## Starting Quest: Changes
Some big change is coming to you or someone near you. The world, or your body, or your soul, or that of a friend—it’s shifting into a different state.
### Major Goals
The HG can award you 5 XP towards this quest when:
- [ ] you have a traumatic transformation or dissociation scene in play, where your reality gets weird because your true nature is changing or revealing itself.
- [ ] you see a confusing vision, nightmare, or premonition of your or someone else’s death.
- [ ] you meet and get the chance to help a mysterious child find their way.
### Quest Flavor
1/chapter, you can earn a bonus XP towards this quest when:
- [ ] wrestling with/expressing nameless feelings of loss that make you act unnaturally
- [ ] trying and failing to burn things, to light them on fire
- [ ] getting confused about who and where you are
- [ ] listening to stories about things that were lost when the sun died
- [ ] talking with somebody about your destiny/nature and what it means
- [ ] talking with somebody about why there’s such a thing as death
- [ ] dealing with aches, broken bones, acne, ear infections, or other annoyingly intrusive elements of physicality/mortality.
You can combine this with an XP Action, but you’re not required to.

XP: 0/35
### Basic Quest: Generic Quest (Background)
**Bonus XP**
There’s something you just have to live through, day by day:
**I am severed from the relationship & power that makes me who I am.**

And there’s something—some experience or memory—that helps mark out those days.
There is something that draws your attention when this quest casts its shadow or its light upon your life.
You can earn a bonus XP towards this quest at any time (but only once per scene/15 minutes) by directing attention to this experience. This usually relies on a specific catch phrase—e.g., your attention drifts to the birds flying out over Big Lake, and you say, “Listen to those birds.”
...or whatever.
What catch phrase do you use?
**The sun is so warm.**
